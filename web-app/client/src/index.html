      A Python dictionary with Redis as the storage back-end. Redis is a great database for all kinds of
      environments; from simple to complex. redis-dict tries to make using Redis as simple as using a
      dictionary. redis-dict stores data in Redis with key-values, this is according to Redis best
      practices. This also allows other non-Python programs to access the data stored in Redis.
